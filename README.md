## 📚 What’s Inside : 
»⟫ Basics >> Where you revise/learn.
»⟫ Problems >> Application of Basics to build up Logic.
»⟫ Projects >> Combining logic to create and build small projects.

### 🔸 Core Concepts
Java basics, including:
- Variables, user input, arithmetic
- If statements, loops, switches
- Methods, scope, overloading
- Arrays, ArrayLists, 2D arrays
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Constructors, inheritance, polymorphism
- Abstraction, interfaces, composition
- Exception handling, file I/O
- Threads, timers, generics, enums

Each file is timestamped and emoji-tagged so it’s easy to scan and revisit.
